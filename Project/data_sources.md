## Description

These datasets have been developed to support a range of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. The dataset comprises both infected and uninfected blood smear images, encompassing both thick and thin smear slides. The effort to creating this datasets is motivated by the goal of advancing malaria diagnostic systems in Tanzania through the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques. By automating these diagnostic processes, we aim to mitigate subjective errors, reduce the time required for diagnosis, and alleviate the labor-intensive nature of traditional diagnostic methods.

# Cancer Imaging Archive

## Description

TCIA data are organized as “collections”; typically these are patient cohorts related by a common disease (e.g. lung cancer), image modality or type (MRI, CT, digital histopathology, etc) or research focus. Supporting data related to the images such as patient outcomes, treatment details, genomics and image analyses are also provided when available.

There are two distinct search mechanisms that can be used to find datasets of interest.  The free text search bar functions just like a regular search engine and will return all dataset homepages that contain your query terms.  Alternatively, you can browse the table of datasets below and use the filter box to refine the results.

## Description

The SIPaKMeD Database consists of 4049 images of isolated cells that have been manually cropped from 966 cluster cell images of Pap smear slides. These images were acquired through a CCD camera adapted to an optical microscope. The cell images are divided into five categories containing normal, abnormal and benign cells.
